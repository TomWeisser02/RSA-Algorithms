To generate the keys for the RSA en- and decryption, we firstly need to choose p and q. Both need to be prime, since we need to calculate Phi(N).
 N ist the product of p and q. Phi(N), which we call M for now, will later be used to generate d, the number which represents the private key with N. 

Euler's phi function is being used to determine the amount of coprime numbers to N between included 1 and N.
So when N is a prime number, we know the result will be N-1. This function is very important since there isn't 
a simple formula to calculate, how many coprime numbers there are. The only way to find out is to bruteforce,
which is also very ineffective considering we use really huge numbers.
The reason we know M, is because we determined p and q and both are prime numbers. 

So: 
phi(N) = phi(p*q) = phi(p) * phi(q) = (p-1)*(q-1) = M

To generate d, we firstly need to choose a number e, which together with N represents the public key. 
Keep in mind that e needs to be coprime and smaller than M, otherwise it has no multiplicative inverse with mod M (to know why this is, you need a fundamental understanding of modular arithmetic). 

To calculate the multiplicative inverse of e mod M, we need to apply the extended euclidean algorithm. Like the name says, 
it is an extended version of the euclidean algorithm, which in turn is being used to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd, or in german ggT). 
The big difference between both algorithms is that one just gives the greatest common divisor and the other establishes a linear equation in which we can read out the multiplicative inverse d.

Now (e,N) provides the public and (d, N) the private key.
